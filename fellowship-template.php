<p>	During the 11-month program, fellows not only work together to solve local problems, but also receive the training and support to be positioned as a leader in business, public service, or both:</p>
    <ul id="why">

      <li><strong class="number">3</strong> <strong>Alumni Connections.</strong> Working closely with other talented individuals, you will develop lasting professional relationships in a face-paced, startup atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">4</strong> <strong>Employer Partnerships.</strong> Multiple leading internet companies have already pledged to guarantee interviews for a full-time position after your CfA experience.</li>
