<p>	During the 11-month program, fellows not only work together to solve local problems, but also receive the training and support to be positioned as a leader in business, public service, or both:</p>
    <ul id="why">
      <li><strong class="number">1</strong> <strong>Gov 2.0 Training.</strong> You will start with a crash course in municipal government and gain a practical understanding of the vital intersection of politics and technology.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">2</strong> <strong>Professional Development.</strong> The biggest names in the web industry and the Gov 2.0 movement will provide you unparalleled networking, mentoring, and support.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">3</strong> <strong>Alumni Connections.</strong> Working closely with other talented individuals, you will develop lasting professional relationships in a fast-paced, startup atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">4</strong> <strong>Employer Partnerships.</strong> Multiple leading internet companies have already pledged to guarantee interviews for a full-time position after your CfA experience.</li>

      <p>Anyone with the skills and passion to make cities work better using technology. Many of you will be starting your careers, but others of you will have been working on the web for years and just want a chance to do something important and altruistic. All of you will want to see your work make a difference to cities and change how government works.</p>
