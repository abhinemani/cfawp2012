    <h2>OUR FELLOWSHIP</h2>
    <p>Through Code for America's fellowship program, passionate web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs collaborate with municipal leaders to leverage the power of the internet -- to make government better, more efficient for us all. In doing so, fellows develop new skills, create a broad network of civic and tech leaders, and most of all, have an impact.</p>

<p>The Code for America Fellowship is an 11-month program where developers, designers, researchers, and product managers work with city staff to produce open-source <a href="/apps">web apps</a> to improve city services and the community. Fellows work out of the San Francisco office for the bulk of the year -- traveling to their assigned partner cities for the month February and various times throughout the year to meet with community members and city staff, and test their apps. Fellows receive $35,000 USD, professional development opportunities, and healthcare benefits.</p>

      <h3 class="ttl">The Training <a href="/fellows/institute/" class="more">Read More</a></h3>
<p>	During the 11-month program, fellows not only work together to help cities innovate, but also receive the training and support to be positioned as a leader in business, public service, or both:</p>
    <ul id="why">
      <li><strong class="number">1</strong> <strong>Civic Tech Training.</strong> You will start with a crash course in municipal government and gain a practical understanding of the vital intersection of politics and technology.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">2</strong> <strong>Professional Development.</strong> The biggest names in the web industry and the Gov 2.0 movement will provide you unparalleled networking opportunities, mentorship and support.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">3</strong> <strong>Connections.</strong> Working closely with other talented individuals, you will develop lasting relationships in a fast-paced, startup atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">4</strong> <strong>A Labor of Love.</strong> You’ll not only accomplish a lot and make the world a better place, you’ll have a lot of fun working with other passionate people. To borrow a line from the Peace Corps, it will be the toughest job you’ll ever love.</li>
