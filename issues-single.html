		<p>Openness in government can come about in many different ways: public information is freely available and useful; the workings of government are made transparent; or those working in the public interest develop the "new commons", freely available civic tools and knowledge. At their core, however, is an important and common underlying principle; that by reducing barriers and sharing what we create, we can work together to make our governments and communities more efficient and effective.</p>

<p>This idea is expressed in areas as different as the open source software movement and the decades-long push for better freedom of information laws, and it is now a core value in our work to make government function more like the web. In this way, openness is a basic requirement for the success of CfA. Open data and shared tools are necessary to enable the efficiency and participation that we help governments achieve, so that residents can lead better lives. And only when openness thrives in all its forms will the future that we imagine - where all parts of our society are able to join with government as co-creators of the civic space - will be possible.</p>

<strong>Innovative Strategies</strong>

<p><strong>Becoming an Open City</strong><br>
In 2009, the City of Portland, OR, was first in the nation to become official "open" by resolving to release the city's public data online and allow open-source solutions in government procurement. Near the same time San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom also directed his government to put its data online, and adopted a policy that open-source options have to get equal consideration in large software contracts. A host of cities including Washington D.C., Manor, TX, and Seattle, WA, are following suit, releasing city data and encouraging the private sector to make use of it through app contests.</p>

<p><strong>Growing a Community of Civic Hackers</strong><br>
The Sunlight Foundation has led the way in creating a space for people with coding skills to work collaboratively on projects that impact government. Their Sunlight Labs initiative provides the basic infrastructure that powers an open community of civic hackers. At Sunlight the focus in on creating tools that liberate public data and promote government transparency and accountability. This is a model that Code for America hopes to replicate with our own community of civic hackers, which will have a similar ethos and much camaraderie with our friends at Sunlight, while supporting a different range of projects to benefit municipalities.</p>

<p><strong>Crowd-sourcing Access to Government Information</strong><br>
The technology of distributed networks now makes it possible to collect information from "the crowd," meaning people who are not organized or even talking with one another, but are contributing something to a common effort. One new application that does this is the Open CRS project of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which "crowdsources" copies of policy reports from the Congressional Research Service. While these documents are in the public domain, the CRS is prohibited by law from distributing them to the public. Instead Open CRS lets anyone who has a copy post it online, so now there are thousands to view.</p>
