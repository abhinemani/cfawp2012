		<p>Openness in government can come about in many different ways: public information is freely available and useful; the workings of government are made transparent; or those working in the public interest develop the "new commons", freely available civic tools and knowledge. At their core, however, is an important and common underlying principle; that by reducing barriers and sharing what we create, we can work together to make our governments and communities more efficient and effective.</p>

	<h3 style="background:url(<?php bloginfo( 'template_url' ); ?>/images/participation.gif) center center no-repeat"><a href="#">Participation</a></h3>
	<div>
		<p>Central to our work is the belief that the challenges our communities face will only be met by enlisting the contributions of people and organizations from across society in pursuit of our common interests.  In the United States, we live a paradox of low levels of political participation combined with high levels of public service and philanthropy. The usual ways to participate, like voting and attending public meetings, are seen by most as poor means to change their communities for the better.  But people are still very interested in improving the quality of life where they live.</p>

<p>By harnessing the strong desire of people to contribute their time and expertise toward improving their  communities, and to have a meaningful way to be involved in decisions that effect their lives, we think that a new relationship can be forged between people and their governments.  Technology is enabling us to go beyond the typical ways of engaging with government, and become much more collaborative and inclusive.  Code for America is helping drive this change by working with governments to establish platforms where participation can happen, and to bring more citizen-centered practices to how public institutions operate.</p>

	<h3 style="background:url(<?php bloginfo( 'template_url' ); ?>/images/education.gif) center center no-repeat"><a href="#">Education</a></h3>
	<div>
		<p>The gap between the US and international leaders in student proficiency in basic subjects as well as science and technology is growing, and it is undermining: the ability of our students to compete for the jobs of the future; the health of our economy; and the intellectual capital we need to solve the problems that confront our communities and our world. Improving our schools and making sure that every child has a opportunity for an education that will allow them to lead a rewarding, productive life is a recognized imperative at the local, state and national levels.</p>

<p>The foundation for many current attempts to improve education is the use of data to make decisions, with states and districts creating systems to track and report standardized test scores. Web-based platforms will take the use of educational data in new directions, bringing up-to-date information about each student to bear on decision-making at the classroom, school and district levels; and empowering students and parents to make informed choices as they direct a student's progress through school.  And by smartly aggregating, presenting, and using the available educational data in combination with data from after-school and community programs, we can paint a more complete picture of each student, and ensure that everyone invested in his or her future has the information they need to maximize their impact.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Times are tough for American cities dealing with the financial crisis: A 2009 survey by the National League of Cities found that 84% of cities were facing significant financial difficulties and 92% expected to have trouble meeting citizen's needs. Between budget cutbacks and increasing demands for services, it's more crucial than ever to make sure that city government's resources are managed effectively to achieve the most impact. By introducing innovative technological solutions and opening city data, we can help cities do more and work better by decreasing bureaucratic burdens, lowering costs, and streamlining service delivery.</p>
<p>
Web-based tools have the potential to revolutionize the way we approach the business of government and reinvigorate a commitment to civic innovation in our cities. At its core, improving local government efficiency is about freeing up time, money, and energy to allow cities to focus on what's really importantâ€”providing for the needs of their citizens and improving the quality of life in their community.</p>
