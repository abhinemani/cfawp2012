As many of you know, the Code for America Fellowship is a year long program focused on civic collaboration and innovation. But don’t take our word for it. Find out what past partners have to say about the program. </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Fellowship partners talented teams of developers, designers, and entrepreneurs with change agents from local governments to address a range of civic challenges. Benefits to participation include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Catalyst for innovation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>New perspectives on issues your city is facing</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Products &amp; interfaces that are simple, beautiful and easy to use</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration with a network of civic innovators and thought leaders</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Visibility on a national stage</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The fellows commit to a year of service earning a living-wage stipend and move through the highly structured program using agile “Lean Startup” techniques to develop and implement web and mobile applications that show what’s possible, deeply engage citizens, and increase the transparency of government information and systems. Outcomes include increased civic engagement, strengthened relationships inside and outside of government, and technology tools and products targeted to a pressing issue your city is facing.</p>

      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <p>Code for America asks each city to fund the direct costs of the fellows—their stipend, benefits, and travel/lodging expenses. The average cost is $180K for a team of three, and most cities allocate these costs through a budget appropriation. We also ask each city to find matching funds of an equal amount to fund the fellows training, equipment, etc. These funds typically come from an institutional funder or local corporate sponsor. You can learn more about funding options and process on the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/faqs-cities-applying-to-program/">CfA Funding FAQ</a>.</p>
